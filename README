This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=839

Only supports gvim, because there is not much you can do with only 2 shades of green in cterm. 

A colour scheme for people editing python, its very 'green' and 'pythonic', its also very 'untidy' and 'unfinished'. The next version should be alot cleaner.

ps: I modified an existing colour scheme I already had installed, I cannot remember which, so If you recognise your own work, umm.. get over it :)
